# Benchmarks:

## Frame size: 1000px X 1000px

### Number of particles and FPS:

* 250/170

* 500/70

* 1000/25

------------
# Change log / current status:
Feb-18th
* Implemented coefficient of restitution
* Implemented mass aware collision
* Shading particles based on mass

Feb-19th
* Variable particle radii
* Tested buoyancy (success)
* Implemented linear interpolation for collisions

Feb-20th
* Fixed and tested linear interpolation
* Refactored code avoid redefinitions of dt
------------
# Future work:

* Start looking at n^2 collision check optimization
